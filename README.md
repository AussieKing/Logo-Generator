## Description
This application allows the user to respond to prompts and generate a file ("logo.svg") with the answers given directly from the command line.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command(s):
- Clone the repository. 
- Install :
  - [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.18.1) 
  - [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) 
  - [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4)
- Open the repository you just cloned with your preferred code editor (I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
- Open the Integrated Terminal (right click), run "npm i" to install all packages, then run "node idex.js" to start the application.

## Usage
Once the above installation is complete, the user will be presented with a series of questions (to enter up to 3 characters to have inside the logo, to select a shape of the logo, and to select a color for both the text and the logo shape).

Once the user has finihed ansering all the questions, a "logo.svg" file is created, reflecting the user's choices.

The logo can be viewed using the "preview" function.
**NOTE** 
The application only allows one logo at the time to be saved, so when the user generates a new logo, the previous one will be automatically replaced.
